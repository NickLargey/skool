3.4.3:
```julia
function iterativeRefinement(A, b, tol)
	x = A \ b
	while true
		r = b - A * x

		if norm(r) / norm(b) < tol
			println("Converged")
			return x
		end
	e = A \ r
	x = x + e
	end
end
```

Concept Check 3.4.4:
1.  What is the condition number of a square nonsingular matrix A, and what is it's significance for solving $Ax=b$ ?
	1. The condition number is used to show the sensitivity of the matrix so that x(0) can be the exact solution and x(e) is the computed solution.
2. What is the geometric interpretation of the condition number?
	1. The geometric interpretation how much a unit sphere is altered when transformed by the matrix
3. Which measure is more appropriate for determining whether a matrix is nearly singular: the determinant or the condition number?
	1. The condition number
4. Briefly describe, in words, the process of iterative refinement. When is it most effective?
	1. Iterative refinement is the process of correcting the error in the solution by repeatedly calculating the residual of the current  iterations solution. It's most effective when you're dealing with ill-conditioned matrices.
5. What is the benefit of scaling the equations in the system Ax=b, even though it does not change the solution?
	1. It increases stability (reduces round-off error for example) and accuracy by reducing the condition number. 

Exercise 1.b : 
Floating point precision will error out around 1 x 10^-17 or 1 x 10^-18 depending on your computer
```julia
function cond_mat()
	itr = 0
	while itr < 20
		e = .1
		while e > 0
			A = [1 1+e; 1-e 1]
			L, U = lu(A)
			itr += 1
			e *= .1
		end
	print(itr)
	end
end
